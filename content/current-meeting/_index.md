The 2024 WAIS Workshop will be held in Gainesville, Florida, at the Hilton UF Conference Center, located on the University of Florida campus. This NSF- and NASA-sponsored meeting hosts transdisciplinary and societally critical science focused on marine ice-sheet and adjacent Earth systems, with particular emphasis on the West Antarctic Ice Sheet and how it will impact global coastlines, including our host state's. The 2024 meeting is hosted locally by Mickey MacKie (University of Florida) and the rest of WAIS Organizing Committee (Knut Christianson, Brooke Medley, Lauren Miller, Peter Neff, and Matt Siegfried). The 2024 abstract booklet and agenda can be found here. 

The meeting begins with an icebreaker pizza dinner on Monday evening, November 11. Sessions are organized by topic, with keynote speakers for some sessions, followed by contributed talks and concluding with a panel discussion. Poster sessions will be held separately. We anticipate about 40-45 talks. The formal meeting agenda will end at lunch on Thursday, November 14, followed by afternoon short-courses led by conmunity members for anyone interested in attending. We will also continue our annual workshop-wide community discussion as part of the scientific agenda.
